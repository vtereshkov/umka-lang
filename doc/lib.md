# The Umka Standard Library Reference

All standard library modules are embedded into the Umka interpreter binary. They are not provided as standalone files.

## Basic library: `std.um`

### Error handling

#### Types

```
type ErrPos* = struct {
    file: str
    func: str
    line: int
}
```

Call stack trace position from where `error()` has been called.

```
type Err* = struct {
    code: int
    msg: str
    sender: any
    trace: []ErrPos
}
```

Error description. A zero `code` means no error.

```
type StdErr* = enum {
    ok     = 0           // No error
    buffer = 1           // Wrong buffer size
    ptr    = 2           // Pointers cannot be read or written
    nullf  = 3           // File is null
    eof    = 4           // End of file
}
```

Error codes set by the standard library functions in the `Err` structure. 

#### Functions

``` 
fn error*(code: int = 0, msg: str = "", sender: any = null): Err
```

Generates an error description with a call stack trace.

```
fn exitif*(err: Err)
```

Terminates the program if `err.code` is not zero, prints the error message and the call stack trace stored in `err`.

### Memory 

#### Functions

```
fn tobytes*(buf: any): []uint8
```

Copies the bytes of `buf` to a byte array.

```
fn frombytes*(buf: any, bytes: []uint8): Err
```

Copies the `bytes` array to `buf`. If unsuccessful, returns `StdErr.buffer` or `StdErr.ptr` in `Err`.

### Input/output

#### Types

```
type File* = ^struct {}
```

File handle.

```
type SeekFrom* = enum {
    begin                   // Beginning of file
    cur                     // Current position
    end                     // End of file
}
```

#### Functions

#### Types

```
type Array* = []any
```
Array of any items.

#### Functions

```
fn (a: ^Array) transform*(f: fn (x: any): any): Array
```
Computes the function `f` for each item `x` of the array `a^` and returns the array of results.

```
fn (a: ^Array) filter*(f: fn (x: any): bool): Array

```
Computes the function `f` for each item `y` of the array `a^` starting from index `i = 1` to `len(a^) - 1`. The previous result of `f` computed for items 1 to `i - 1` is passed as `x`. For `i = 1` it is assumed that `x = a[0]`. Returns the result of `f` computed for the last item of `a^`.

Example:
```
import "fnc.um"

    less := fn (x: any): bool |max| {return int(x) < max} 
    sum  := fn (x, y: any): any     {return int(x) + int(y)}     
    
    result := int(fnc.Array(data).transform(sqr).filter(less).reduce(sum))
