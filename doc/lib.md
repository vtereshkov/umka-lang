# The Umka Standard Library Reference

All standard library modules are embedded into the Umka interpreter binary. They are not provided as standalone files.

## Basic library: `std.um`

### Memory 

#### Functions

```
fn tobytes*(buf: any): []uint8
```

Copies the bytes of `buf` to a byte array.

```
fn frombytes*(buf: any, bytes: []uint8)
```

Copies the `bytes` array to `buf`. An error is triggered if some of the bytes represent a pointer.

### Input/output

#### Types

```
type File* = ^struct {}
```

File handle.

#### Constants

```
const (
    seekBegin* = 0
    seekCur*   = 1
    seekEnd*   = 2
)
```

Codes defining the offset origins in `fseek()`: the beginning of file, the current position, the end of file.

#### Functions

```
fn stdin* (): File
fn stdout*(): File
fn stderr*(): File
```

Return file handles for standard input, output, and error output devices.

```
fn fopen*(name: str, mode: str): File

"rb"  read from a binary file
"w"   write to a text file
"wb"  write to a binary file
```

## Functional programming library: `fnc.um`

#### Types

```
type Array* = []any
```
Array of any items.

#### Functions

```
fn (a: ^Array) transform*(f: fn (x: any): any): Array
```
Computes the function `f` for each item `x` of the array `a^` and returns the array of results.

```
fn (a: ^Array) filter*(f: fn (x: any): bool): Array 
```
Computes the function `f` for each item `x` of the array `a^` and returns the array of all the items of `a^` for which `f` evaluates to `true`.

```
fn (a: ^Array) reduce*(f: fn (x, y: any): any): any
```
Computes the function `f` for each item `y` of the array `a^` starting from index `i = 1` to `len(a^) - 1`. The previous result of `f` computed for items 1 to `i - 1` is passed as `x`. For `i = 1` it is assumed that `x = a[0]`. Returns the result of `f` computed for the last item of `a^`.

Example:
```
import "fnc.um"

fn main() {
    data := []int{3, 7, 1, -4, 2, 5}

    max := 30
     
    sqr  := fn (x: any): any        {return int(x) * int(x)}
    less := fn (x: any): bool |max| {return int(x) < max} 
    sum  := fn (x, y: any): any     {return int(x) + int(y)}     
    
    result := int(fnc.Array(data).transform(sqr).filter(less).reduce(sum))
